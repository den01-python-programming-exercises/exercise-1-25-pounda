# Exercise 1.25 - Larger Than or Equal To

Write a program that prompts the user for two integers and prints the larger of the two. If the numbers are the same, then the program informs us about this as well.

Sample outputs:

```plaintext
Give the first number:
*5*
Give the second number:
*3*
Greater number is: 5
```

```plaintext
Give the first number:
*5*
Give the second number:
*8*
Greater number is: 8
```

```plaintext
Give the first number: 
*5*
Give the second number: 
*5*
The numbers are equal!
```
